# RAVE pre-trained models latent space visualization
In this notebook, we delve into several pre-models for RAVE drum/percussion. Specifically, we visualize the encoded embeddings generated by each model using a dataset of one-shot hits from various parts of the drumkit (e.g., Kick Drum (KD), Snare Hit (SD)).

## Set up development environment 

```
pyenv install 3.9.9
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.9 raversenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## TODO
* Manipulate embeddings
* Interpolate between embeddings
* Realtime interpolation
